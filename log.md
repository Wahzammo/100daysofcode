# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have started on the 2nd last project for the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It was interesting after not doing any coding for at least a fortnight, it took me a good 30mins to get my head back in the game....

### Day 2: August 11th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  Picked things up again a little faster today, is interesting as I "rip" the source site how I am noticing how poorly it is designed...

### Day 3: August 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It is quite deceptive how much content actually goes into a relatively simple webpage; I am trying to use HTML as much as possible to keep page light..

### Day 5: August 14th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on FCC;  More ES6 challenges tonight: 

Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters;  
Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays;  
Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters;  
Create Strings using Template Literals;  
Write Concise Object Literal Declarations;   
Using Object Property Shorthand;   
Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6;  
Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

**Thoughts**  After a late night and long week of study I was struggling big time; I will definately need to review all this mor than once to let it sink in.... the destructuring was doing my head in, I knew what it was asking just the code changes did not seem obvious at times. I referred to Mozilla a fair bit to assist and only needed to see the answers on two of the problems.

### Day 6: August 15th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today back to working on my C# coding, specifically my terminal hacker game... trying to figure out the ins and outs the existing code base to get the lines on the terminal formatted with line breaks but in a way that doesn't have + '\n' fucking everywhere!!!!     

**Thoughts** I feel like taking the existing code base and pulling it apart, rewriting, see what happens is very similar to my early industrial controls days, let's just wire it up this way and see what happens.. at least with code the risk of explosions or fires is ZERO :laughing:  I am having fun if not making much progress, but at least after today I know more than I did yesterday even if the code has not increased much. Knowing what not to do is still a valuable thing!

### Day 7: August 16th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today back to working on my C# coding, specifically my terminal hacker game... changed code to not have excessive '\n'.. further worked on hacker.cs, builidng out player target options..    

**Thoughts** Was totally stoked to come back and solve the '\n' issue within about 10 mins this morning/afternoon... really felt great to know that the work I did yesterday did infact improve my understanding of the code base.

### Day 8: August 17th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  back into the Responsive Web Design Projects on #freeCodeCamp. Continued on my technical documentation page. Finished with HTML and content onto CSS!!!    

**Thoughts** Nice to making progress, really starting to remember the HTML now without to much pondering. I think it is important to have a good understanding of the basics of getting content into the DOM in its simplest form.... HTML makes walls of text readable and functional and should not be overlooked.

### Day 9: August 18th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  had a crack at some more of the Javascript stuff on freecodecamp and realised that I was brute forcing my way through the content and not really learning JS... I have bought a udemy course to correct this... since a sale was on bought an CSS course also to cement my learning further, started with the CSS.    

**Thoughts** There really are no short cuts, just like my sparkie skills, you can only develop real understanding by doing and doing often..

### Day 10: August 19th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  continuing on with the Udemy course CSS-The Complete Guide 2020... today we covered BOX styling.    

**Thoughts** Again, I pretty much have to repeat... There really are no short cuts, just like my sparkie skills, you can only develop real understanding by doing and doing often..

### Day 11: August 20th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  continuing on with the Udemy course CSS-The Complete Guide 2020... today we covered creating the nav bar and discussed inline element behaviours in detail.    

**Thoughts** I am so glad I took this course, I have learned things already that was not included in the FCC course, but will be super helpful! Also, coding with a hangover is no fun.

**Today's Progress**:  continuing on with the Udemy course CSS-The Complete Guide 2020... today we covered styling anchor's and creating simple repsonsive buttons.    

**Thoughts** Another Friday and another struggle, just hard to stay awake!! So I had a nap and then came back to it later!! Arvo naps FTW!

### Day 13: August 22th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  After staying up unitl 4am playing Satisfactory with mates, I managed to open the IDE and orgainse the folder structure and that was it! Technically this will have to go down as a missed opportunity due to other commitments!    

**Thoughts** Well, maybe I can swing it that playing games all night with mates is market research???

### Day 14: August 23th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  today I went a little left field and started on learning how Unity handles non-player AI.. started with a quick brief on vector maths! I am following Penny de Byl's course, The Beginner's Guide to Artificial Intelligence in Unity. A practical guide to programming non-player characters for games.     

**Thoughts** I managed an hour of learning, and about an hour of creating git repo, cloning it, setting up the unity project... must remember that setup takes time! About an hour so, I am wondering if there is quicker way? Like with the NPM install package...

### Day 15: August 24th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  I am writing this after 5 hours sleep after a 40 hour gaming binge!! Let me hear you cry "One more level!"... the game is Satisfactory and is just stunning, it is a first-person open-world factory building game with a dash of exploration and combat. Play alone or with friends, explore an alien planet, create multi-story factories, and enter conveyor belt heaven! The developers Coffee Stain Studios have done a fine job! No code today, but I did watch the youtube documentary on Double Fine Adventure and Tim Schafer following the four development process around making the game Broken Age, all 12 hours of it!    

**Thoughts** I am way too old to be staying up for days straight gaming, but I love it! I can't think of another medium that can keep you so engaged when done well. This is why I want to make games!

### Day 16: August 25th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: continuing on with the Udemy course CSS-The Complete Guide 2020... today we covered selectors and other general features.     

**Thoughts** After so much fun with the gaming, I wonder why I bother with the web dev stuff, should I just focus on game dev? I dunno, I feel that my chances in getting employment will be higher with web dev....

### Day 17 - 21: August 25th - 29th

**Today's Progress**: this week has almost been a write off, had some personal issues to deal with and a bout of a 'wtf did I eat' 24hr illness...   

**Thoughts** It is interesting how quickly 1 day missed can turn into 4 without even blinking, I really need to stick to a no zero day policy... constitency and perstiance is key!

### Day 32 : September 9th

**Today's Progress**: It is has been 10 days since I coded, almost made it to 3 weeks... but in my defense I did stop to focus on my Cert IV in Project Management which I completed on Monday Partying face I will start R2 next week!!   

**Thoughts** Sometimes you just gotta take it easy on yourself and realise that your eyes being bigger than your stomach is totally a thing.
