# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have started on the 2nd last project for the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It was interesting after not doing any coding for at least a fortnight, it took me a good 30mins to get my head back in the game....

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  Picked things up again a little faster today, is interesting as I "rip" the source site how I am noticing how poorly it is designed...

### Day 3: August 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It is quite deceptive how much content actually goes into a relatively simple webpage; I am trying to use HTML as much as possible to keep page light..

### Day 5: August 14th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on FCC;  More ES6 challenges tonight: 

Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters;  
Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects;

**Thoughts**  After a late night and long week of study I was struggling big time; I will definately need to review all this mor than once to let it sink in.... the destructuring was doing my head in, I knew what it was asking just the code changes did not seem obvious at times. I referred to Mozilla a fair bit to assist and only needed to see the answers on two of the problems.
