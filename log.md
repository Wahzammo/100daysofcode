# 100 Days Of Code - Log 1.1

### Day 1: September 14th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have completed on the 2nd last project for the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Using Basic HTML and CSS to Build a Technical Documentation Page   

**Thoughts**  DeJaVu but.... It was interesting after not doing any coding for at least a fortnight, it took me a good 30mins or so to get my head back in the game, seems to be a pattern. I guess that's why the 100 day challenge is so effective, it really helps with building habits, cementing your learning and keeps you semi-accountable to the No Zero Days concept...

### Day 1: September 15th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I the last project for the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Using Basic HTML and CSS to Build a Personal Portfolio Page   

**Thoughts**  Another dau of realising that coding is a habit that must be fed! Starting the initial project from scratch took me a little while to get confident about putting code on the screen. I kept thinking about templates or the proper way to layout the html... in the end I just completed user story 1 and then went onto user story 2 and before I knew it I had the basics on the page ready for personalising!
