# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 10th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I have started on the 2nd last project for the FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It was interesting after not doing any coding for at least a fortnight, it took me a good 30mins to get my head back in the game....

### Day 2: August 11th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  Picked things up again a little faster today, is interesting as I "rip" the source site how I am noticing how poorly it is designed...

### Day 3: August 12th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued on the 2nd last project for the FCC Responsive Web Design Projects Certification. Basic HTML and CSS

**Thoughts**  It is quite deceptive how much content actually goes into a relatively simple webpage; I am trying to use HTML as much as possible to keep page light..

### Day 4: August 13th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I restarted the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on FCC;   
ES6 challenges tonight:   
Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords;   
Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords;   
Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword;   
Mutate an Array Declared with const;   
Prevent Object Mutation;   
Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions;

### Day 5: August 14th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on FCC;  More ES6 challenges tonight: 

Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters;  
Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays;  
Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements;  
Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters;  
Create Strings using Template Literals;  
Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand;  
Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6; 
Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

**Thoughts**  After a late night and long week of study I was struggling big time; I will definately need to review all this mor than once to let it sink in.... the destructuring was doing my head in, I knew what it was asking just the code changes did not seem obvious at times. I referred to Mozilla a fair bit to assist and only needed to see the answers on two of the problems.

### Day 6: August 15th, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today back to working on my C# coding, specifically my terminal hacker game... trying to figure out the ins and outs the existing code base to get the lines on the terminal formatted with line breaks but in a way that doesn't have + '\n' fucking everywhere!!!!     

**Thoughts** I feel like taking the existing code base and pulling it apart, rewriting, see what happens is very similar to my early industrial controls days, let's just wire it up this way and see what happens.. at least with code the risk of explosions or fires is ZERO :laughing:  I am having fun if not making much progress, but at least after today I know more than I did yesterday even if the code has not increased much. Knowing what not to do is still a valuable thing!

### Day 7: August 16th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today back to working on my C# coding, specifically my terminal hacker game... changed code to not have excessive '\n'.. further worked on hacker.cs, builidng out player target options..    

**Thoughts** Was totally stoked to come back and solve the '\n' issue within about 10 mins this morning/afternoon... really felt great to know that the work I did yesterday did infact improve my understanding of the code base.

### Day 8: August 17th, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  back into the Responsive Web Design Projects on #freeCodeCamp. Continued on my technical documentation page. Finished with HTML and content onto CSS!!!    

**Thoughts** Nice to making progress, really starting to remember the HTML now without to much pondering. I think it is important to have a good understanding of the basics of getting content into the DOM in its simplest form.... HTML makes walls of text readable and functional and should not be overlooked.

### Day 9: August 18th, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  had a crack at some more of the Javascript stuff on freecodecamp and realised that I was brute forcing my way through the content and not really learning JS... I have bought a udemy course to correct this... since a sale was on bought an CSS course also to cement my learning further, started with the CSS.    

**Thoughts** There really are no short cuts, just like my sparkie skills, you can only develop real understanding by doing and doing often..
